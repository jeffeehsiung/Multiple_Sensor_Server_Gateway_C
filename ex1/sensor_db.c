/*Create a test program (main.c) and sensor_db module (the storage manager) to store temperature data into a text file, structured as a comma separated value file (csv). Implement both the header (sensor_db.h) and the implementation (sensor_db.c) with the following operations:
• an operation to open a text file with a given name, and providing an indication if the file should be overwritten if the file already exists or if the data should be appended to the existing file.
• an operation to append a single sensor reading to the csv file
• an operation to close the csv file.
